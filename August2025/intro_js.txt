statement: unit of instruction made up of one and more line respresnts an action (ex. let myVar = 4;)

block statement: any number of statements inside a {} block

expression: unit of code that results in value (ex. 2+2 or grouping operator (2*2) + 2)

weak typing: value doesnt need to explicitly marked as specific type 
and through type coercion you can do things like adding a num with a string

case sensitivity: true, white space insensitive

Data types : 
1) primitives -> a value with no wrapper or property of its own
- primitive literals are immutable for example a bool variable isOk can be true and then
reassigned as false but literal true can never respresnts another value other than true

seven primitive data types in JS are as below:
1) Numbers (2) strings (3) booleans (4) null (5) undefined (6) Bigint (7) Symbol

1] Number : value is made up of any series of numeric characters 
can also represent things like NaN and Infinity

when a value is passed to Number() function it becomes number

passing false or null returns 0 while passing true returns 1 if value cant be converted it says NaN (ex. undefined)
